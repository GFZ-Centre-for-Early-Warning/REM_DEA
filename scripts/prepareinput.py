WARNING: OUTDATED SCRIPT but might be of value for some (M.Haas 26.02.16)
    Prepare input files for RRVS survey

Description: this script produces the gps.js and buildings.js files for a specific application
             based on user selection of buildings to be surveyed.
Input: gids of buildings that need to be surveyed
Output: gps.js and buildings.js in /webapp/static/panoimg

TODO: This is a rather static solution with writing to files.
      Ask for building_gid string on start of the application and make it available to the map
      -> than dynamically populate the geojson variables in map.html with the below queries
      -> dont write to file but directly to the variable in the map file (like I did before with php!)
